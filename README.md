# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to use SqlAlchemy to query temperature measurement data and filter by date. Pandas libraries are used to display and visualize data. 
6. Print results to a text file.
## Resources
- Source code : SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb
- Sofware: Python 3.10.4, SQLAlchemy, hawaii.sqlite,Flask, conda
## Summary
The statistical summary of June temperature data

The statisical summary of the dataframe for June temperature indicates that the minimum tempearture was 63 and highest was 85. The data shows the highest 25th percentile and the lowest percentile of data. This can be used to understand the tempeartures at their hottest time of the year for this city.
The statistical summary of December temperature data

The statisical summary of the dataframe for June temperature indicates that the minimum tempearture was 56 and highest was 83. The data shows the highest 25th percentile and the lowest percentile of data. This can be used to understand the tempeartures at their coldest time of the year for this city.

## Challenge Summany

In summary, looking at the average tempeature in June and December for the city shows that the variation in temperatures is not significant throughout the year. The surfs and ice cream shop decision to open up throughout the year is valid.
